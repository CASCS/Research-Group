  Background: Providing accommodating resistance with the use of elastic bands
  (EB) to enhance strength and power in different populations are well studied.
  However, little is known about its contribution to enhancing muscle
  endurance. 


  Purpose: The study’s purpose was to compare free-weight with and without EB tension on upper-body maximal strength and strength-endurance in bench press (BP) exercise.


  Methods: A sample of 26 trained males (age 26 ± 2.4 years; body mass 73 ± 7.6 kg; stature 172 ± 5.8 cm) were randomly allocated to one of two parallel groups [CON (n = 13) or EXP (n = 13)] and completed 2 weekly BP sessions during a 12-week period. Training programmes were the same except that the EXP group executed the BP with 30% of the prescribed load arising from the utilisation of EB. BP one-repetition maximum (1RM) and maximum number of repetitions (MNR) to muscular fatigue were tested before and after the intervention. 


  Results: An analysis of covariance with the pre-test value as the covariate revealed that both CON and EXP groups exhibited improvement in maximal strength and muscular endurance. However, the EXP group experienced significantly larger improvements (1RM: CON=12%; EXP=14% / MNR: CON=7%; EXP=27%).


  Conclusion: Combined free-weight and elastic bands may offer a higher training stimulus than free-weight resistance to improve upper-body strength and muscular endurance in adult trained men.
